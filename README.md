# March Madness Kaggle 

My model incorporates historical NCAA data privided by Kaggle, Ken Pomeroy's adjusted ratings NCAA, ELO ratings, and historical betting odds. I used Python and Scikit-Learn to develop and fine-tune the models. 

I'll be updating this repository throughout the tournament to clean it up and experiment with alternative setups. I decided to enter last minute on a whim, so it needs a bit of work.
